It follows REST architectural principles, such as stateless communication, resource-based URLs, and the use of standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. RESTful APIs typically return data in JSON or XML format and are widely used for building scalable, lightweight, and interoperable web applications.\n","***\n","2: What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n","\n","Answer:\n","Flask is a lightweight and flexible Python web framework used to build web applications and APIs. It is based on the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) standard. Flask is popular because:\n","\n","It is easy to learn and simple to set up.\n","\n","It has minimal dependencies and allows developers to add extensions as needed.\n","\n","It supports RESTful request handling naturally.\n","\n","It is ideal for microservices and small to medium-sized applications.\n","Its simplicity and modularity make Flask a top choice for building RESTful APIs quickly.\n","***\n","3: What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?\n","\n","Answer:\n","The main HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs are:\n","\n","GET: Retrieve data from the server.\n","\n","POST: Send data to the server to create a new resource.\n","\n","PUT: Update an existing resource entirely.\n","\n","PATCH: Partially update an existing resource.\n","\n","DELETE: Remove a resource from the server.\n","\n","OPTIONS: Describe the communication options for the target resource.\n","\n","Each method corresponds to an operation that manipulates or retrieves resources on the server.\n","***"],"metadata":{"id":"5Du8-J1FgLsL"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["4: What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?\n","\n","Answer:\n","The @app.route() decorator in Flask is used to define the URL routes for the application. It maps a specific URL path to a Python function (called a view function) that executes when a user accesses that route.\n","***\n","5: What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy?\n","\n","Answer:\n","Flask-SQLAlchemy is an extension for Flask that integrates the SQLAlchemy ORM (Object Relational Mapper) with Flask applications. It simplifies database management by allowing developers to interact with databases using Python objects instead of raw SQL queries.\n","Key roles include:\n","\n","Managing database connections.\n","\n","Defining models (tables) using Python classes.\n","\n","Performing CRUD operations easily.\n","\n","Supporting multiple database types like SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.\n","***\n","6: How do you create a basic Flask application?\n","\n","Answer:\n","A basic Flask application can be created as follows:\n","\n","from flask import Flask\n","\n","app = Flask(__name__)\n","\n","@app.route('/')\n","def home():\n","    return \"Welcome to Flask!\"\n","\n","if __name__ == '__main__':\n","    app.run(debug=True)\n","\n","\n","Steps:\n","\n","Import Flask.\n","\n","Create an instance of the Flask class.\n","\n","Define routes using the @app.route() decorator.\n","\n","Run the app with app.run().\n","***\n","7: How do you return JSON responses in Flask?\n","\n","Answer:\n","Flask provides the jsonify() function to return JSON responses easily:\n","\n","jsonify() automatically converts Python dictionaries into JSON format and sets the correct MIME type (application/json) in the response header."],"metadata":{"id":"XTaAipQagvPJ"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"aaTZAo5tgKqp","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1761801072505,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":483,"user":{"displayName":"Er Ahtesham Shaikh","userId":"14861975339299452468"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["from flask import Flask, jsonify\n","\n","app = Flask(__name__)\n","\n","@app.route('/data')\n","def get_data():\n","    return jsonify({\"message\": \"Success\", \"status\": 200})\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["8: How do you handle POST requests in Flask?\n","\n","Answer:\n","POST requests in Flask are handled by allowing the route to accept the POST method and accessing request data using the request object."],"metadata":{"id":"HDuTwGmMhwaw"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["9: How do you handle errors in Flask (e.g., 404)?\n","\n","Answer:\n","Errors in Flask can be handled using the @app.errorhandler() decorator.\n","Example:"],"metadata":{"id":"SAiubH1PiFmd"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from flask import Flask, jsonify\n","\n","app = Flask(__name__)\n","\n","@app.errorhandler(404)\n","def not_found(error):\n","    return jsonify({\"error\": \"Resource not found\"}), 404\n"],"metadata":{"id":"9mQ7uFWiiH2z","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1761801184851,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Er Ahtesham Shaikh","userId":"14861975339299452468"}}},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["10: How do you structure a Flask app using Blueprints?\n","\n","Answer:\n","Blueprints allow you to organize a large Flask application into smaller, modular components.\n","Example structure:\n","\n","project/\n","│\n","├── app.py\n","├── users/\n","│   ├── __init__.py\n","│   └── routes.py\n"],"metadata":{"id":"uxWn0WSLiS0Z"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"AByzut7zigHO"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
